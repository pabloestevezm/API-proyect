## API-proyect
  
This project creates an api of some famous people I get from a json with quotes, where I selected 7 of them(these are a few examples):   
 - Myke Tyson
 - Neil Amstrong  
 - Marylin Manson  
  

**src** -- Contains the app.py file with the Flask


1. Create a collection for users. *user/<username>*   
2. Create a collection for chats (not finished)  
3. Add new users to a chat. user(not finished)*  
  

* The structure for this project would be different. Need to change some things to show all that the project supposed to do.   

**To get information from the api run: **    
url = "http://localhost:27017/"     

Pending to develop
